Our project is exploring feature wise classification of the dataset to determine if we could create a hit song prediction. The dataset we chose consist of comprehensive list of the most famous songs of 2023 as listed on Spotify. The dataset contains information such as track name, artist name, release date, Spotify playlists and charts, streaming statistics, Apple Music presence, Deezer presence, Shazam charts, BPM, danceability, valence, energy and various other audio features. Questions we hope to explore and answer in our project: could we use data analytics to predict hit songs?, and which machine learning models are best suited for training on prediction, using the dataset?. In order to do so, we train and test different machine learning models on song features to predict the outcomes and create a confusion matrix.
